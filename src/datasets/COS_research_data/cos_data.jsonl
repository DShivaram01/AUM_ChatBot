A critical outcome of innate immune pathway activation is the induction of type I interferons (IFNs), which act upon surrounding cells to establish an antiviral state and stimulate adaptive immune responses. RING finger protein 114 (RNF114), the focus of this presentation, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that we have characterized as a negative regulator of RLH-mediated IFN transcription and innate immune gene expression in vitro and in vivo. In this study we investigated whether RNF114 might also impact Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) signaling, which coordinates with RLHs to detect additional RNA and DNA viruses. To address this possibility, we: 1) performed a series of IFN promoter/luciferase reporter assay studies with a constitutively active STING and RNF114, 2) assessed STING degradation by RNF114 following co-transfection, and 3) investigated whether the two proteins associated using affinity pull-down studies. Our data showed that STING activation of an IFN promoter is suppressed by RNF114 in a manner similar to RLH inhibition, suggesting that RNF114 targets either a common pathway intermediate, or STING itself. Future studies will utilize primary cells from knockout mice to see if STING or its downstream signaling factors are altered in expression in the absence of RNF114. Long term studies will assess RNF114 knockout mouse responses to STING agonists or DNA viruses and development of autoimmune pathologies.", "metadata": {"title": "IDENTIFICATION OF STIMULATOR OF INTERFERON GENES (STING) PROTEIN AS A NOVEL TARGET OF RNF114 SUPPRESSION OF ANTIVIRAL IMMUNE PATHWAYS", "lead_presenters": ["Kaleb Beasley"], "other_authors": ["Justin Lee", "Morris Sanders"], "mentor": "Douglas Leaman1 and Haewon An2", "department": "1Biology and Environmental Science and 2Chemistry", "category": "Undergraduate Independent", "year": 2025, "keywords": ["sting", "immune", "identification", "suppression", "receptors", "stranded", "ifn", "antiviral"], "source": "Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv", "slug": "identification-of-stimulator-of-interferon-genes-sting-protein-as-a-novel-target"}}

Sakamuri\nDepartment: Chemistry\nCategory: Undergraduate Independent\nYear: 2025\n\nAbstract:\nBrain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) are critical in maintaining blood flow, blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and neurovascular coupling. These cells regulate nutrient exchange and immune surveillance in the central nervous system (CNS), making their function essential for brain homeostasis. While rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, is widely known to impair neuronal function and induce oxidative stress, its impact on BMECs remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated the effects of rotenone on BMEC migration using a wound-healing assay. Human brain endothelial cells (HBECs; Cell Systems, passage 8) were seeded in twenty-four well plates and grown to 100% confluency. A uniform scratch was made, and cells were treated with 0.5 µM rotenone. Phase-contrast images were captured using an ECHO microscope, and wound closure was analyzed with ImageJ. After 12 hours, rotenone significantly impaired cell migration, with a 4.39-fold decrease in wound coverage compared to control (n = 3–4 wells). Mean ± SE wound closure was 4.75 ± 2.45% in controls and 20.9 ± 4.4% in the rotenone group (p = 0.023, two-tailed Student’s t-test). Given that rotenone disrupts mitochondrial function and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), our findings suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction may underlie the impaired migration of BMECs. While rotenone is known to affect neurons and other brain cells, its role in BMEC function has not been previously studied. These results highlight the need for further investigation into how mitochondrial dysfunction in endothelial cells contributes to cerebrovascular pathology.", "metadata": {"title": "ROTENONE INHIBITS HUMAN BRAIN ENDOTHELIAL CELL MIGRATION", "lead_presenters": ["Franziska Dempwolf", "Hongyu Lin"], "other_authors": ["Nadine Rita Bulonza Bisimwa", "Anil Sakamuri", "David S.

During viral infection, the innate immune system is activated, including upregulation of type I interferons that mediate antiviral responses. We’ve shown that rhabdoviral matrix protein (M) plays an important role in blocking cellular gene expression, and thus innate immune responses, by inhibiting host RNA polymerase II. We showed previously that IHNV M protein N terminal deletions of greater than five amino acids (∆5N, ∆10N, ∆20N) resulted in loss of protein stability/detection, and that mutations at the C-terminus altered protein half-life via an interplay between the N- and C-termini. Protein ubiquitination within the C-terminus was implicated and point mutations of three lysines in the C-terminus (K190/193/195A) blocked M instability associated with N-terminus deletions (∆5N and ∆10N). Having validated these results, we have now moved toward creating attenuated recombinant viruses harboring M mutations, including ∆10N, ∆10NC and ∆10N-K190/193/195A. To accomplish this, mutant M genes were PCR amplified and cloned into a full-length viral genome after excision of the wild type M gene. Recombinant genomes were validated by PCR and transfected into EPC fish cells to confirm expression of mutant M. Quantitative RT PCR was used to confirm the presence of M transcripts from the complete genome. Future goals will be to assess virus production and the ability of mutants to support viral replication and impact immune suppression.", "metadata": {"title": "INTEGRATING INFECTIOUS HEMATOPOIETIC NECROSIS VIRUS MATRIX (M) PROTEIN FUNCTIONAL DATA INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ATTENUATED VIRUS FOR VACCINE DEVELOPMENT", "lead_presenters": ["Lama Farris", "Shelbi Rall"], "other_authors": ["Kaleb Beasley", "Jeffrey Ringiesn"], "mentor": "Haewon An1 and Douglas Leaman2", "department": "1Chemistry and 2Biology and Environmental Science", "category": "Undergraduate Independent", "year": 2025, "keywords": ["development", "hematopoietic", "necrosis", "infectious", "protein", "integrating", "functional", "data"], "source": "Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv", "slug": "integrating-infectious-hematopoietic-necrosis-virus-matrix-m-protein-functional-"}}

While research on octopus biomechanics tends to emphasize the versatility of their body and degree of freedom in their movement, we must consider that specific motions will be selected for if they confer fitness. These develop into a predictable set of actions and behaviors, and research has shown that practical actions like punching and tactile communication culminate in a finite number of efficient, stereotyped movements. Arm swimming, the propulsion gained from oscillation of all 8 arms, may provide an excellent model of stereotyped motion, but still lacks formal analysis.

A hardware platform is built from budget-friendly components, including an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, an external analog-to-digital converter ADS1115, and a combination of 3-axis accelerometers and piezoelectric vibration sensors. The total system cost is less than $60, making it suitable for scalable and accessible tactile sensing applications. We are currently collecting a dataset of vibrotactile signals by interacting with various surface textures under controlled motion conditions. To analyze signals in real-time, we use FFT-based frequency analysis for feature extraction followed by compact machine learning classifiers optimized for microcontroller deployment. The experiments aim at identifying optimal sensor configurations, signal lengths, and classification methods. Beyond texture classification, the real-time sensitivity and accuracy of the sensors allow capturing subtle biomechanical phenomena. We created a simple application that displays a growing circle on a tablet, and subjects are asked to follow this expanding circle using an Apple Pencil attached to our sensor system. This controlled movement ensures consistent speed, enabling the sensor system to record vibrations accurately. The captured data allows visual representation and quantification of hand tremors and offers valuable insights into conditions like tremor. This sensor system can help telediagnosis of Parkinson's disease and it has potential biomedical applications, such as evaluating skin properties like hardness or softness, aiding clinicians during palpation tasks for early detection of skin disorders or cancers.

Traditional sequence alignment methods often fail in these cases, and while AlphaFold2 has revolutionized protein structure prediction, its applicability is limited by the vast gap between known protein sequences and predicted structures. Metagenomics datasets alone reveal billions of unique protein sequences, with only a fraction having experimentally determined or reliably predicted structures. Additionally, AlphaFold2's high computational cost often requires hours or even days for large-scale analyses. To address these challenges, we propose a novel embedding-based sequence alignment approach that leverages residue level embeddings from pre-trained protein language models (e.g., ProtT5, ESM-1b).

Okeke\nMentor: Claudia Stein\nDepartment: Biology and Environmental Science\nCategory: Undergraduate Independent\nYear: 2025\n\nAbstract:\nEnsuring food security for the growing human population under global change is a daunting challenge our society is facing. Drought is undoubtedly one of the major abiotic stresses to crop productivity. One promising avenue is the use of plant growth-promoting microbes (PGPM) as bio-fertilizers. We are investigating the potential of extracting PGPM’s from the invasive legume kudzu (Pueriara montana var. lobata). Kudzu is one of the fastest growing and most noxious invasive plants in the US. Results from previous experiments indicate that root endophytes associated with kudzu can have a growth promoting effect on some plant species. Furthermore, kudzu is also known for its ability to endure water stress and soil microbes have been shown to positively influence water regulation for other plants, we propose that kudzu’s drought tolerance is mediated via the soil microbiome. We performed whole-soil inoculation experiments in the greenhouse to assess how kudzu’s soil microbiome influences drought responses of kudzu itself and four different crop species. Our results indicate that during its early seedling establishment phase, kudzu is negatively affected by drought. Growing in its own soil microbial community did not improve growth under drought compared to growing with a non-kudzu associated soil microbiome nor growing without any live soil microbiome. The crop species did not show any improved growth under drought when grown in soil with the kudzu-associated soil microbiome. We discuss future experiments needed to fully assess if kudzu’s soil microbiome could provide drought tolerance to itself or crop species.", "metadata": {"title": "DOES KUDZU’S SOIL MICROBIOME IMPROVE DROUGHT TOLERANCE IN CROPS?", "lead_presenters": ["Darlyn Bravo"], "other_authors": ["Brittney Smith", "Benedict C.

Morphological traits like plant size, leaf area, influence the fitness of a plant. Therefore, pre-adaptation to the climate found in a plant’s novel range may influence its ability to colonize and establish in a new location. Phenotypic plasticity in morphological traits is another mechanism that can aid plants in colonizing new areas, but many invasive species also have the potential to rapidly evolve once they are exposed to novel environments. We used digitized natural history collections to investigate whether leaf area of Vinca minor differs in their invaded range compared to their native range. Vinca minor, commonly known as periwinkle, is a perennial evergreen that forms dense and extensive mats along forest floors.

Our results showed that mean leaf area of Vinca minor was significantly higher in its native range (mean leaf area 348.1 mm2) compared to its invasive range (mean leaf area 295.7 mm2). Having a smaller leaf area in the introduced ranges might indicate rapid adaptation to the new environment, or lower understory competition. It might also indicate a founder effect, where genetic variability of the initially introduced individuals was low and contained mainly individuals with smaller leaves.

Despite advances in treatment, the prognosis for advanced melanoma remains poor, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. Recent studies have investigated the potential of natural compounds, such as manuka honey, for their anticancer properties. Manuka honey, derived from the nectar of the Leptospermum scoparium plant, contains bioactive compounds such as methylglyoxal (MGO), which has demonstrated antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. Emerging evidence suggests that manuka honey may also exhibit antiproliferative activity against cancer cells. This study explores the effects of manuka honey on melanoma cell growth, focusing on its ability to inhibit cell proliferation. In vitro experiments were conducted on melanoma cell line B16-F10, where cells were treated with varying concentrations of manuka honey. The results showed a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability and proliferation, suggesting that manuka honey exerts a significant inhibitory effect on melanoma cell growth. The potential mechanisms underlying these effects may involve the modulation of signaling pathways related to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. These findings provide promising insights into the therapeutic potential of manuka honey as an adjunctive treatment for melanoma. Further studies are needed to explore its effectiveness and its possible role in combination with existing melanoma therapies.", "metadata": {"title": "THE EFFECTS OF MANUKA HONEY ON MELANOMA CELL GROWTH AND PROLIFERATION", "lead_presenters": ["Emilee McCracken"], "other_authors": ["Aeryn Nations"], "mentor": "Ann Marie O’Neill, Tim Kroft", "department": "Biology and Environmental Science", "category": "Undergraduate Independent", "year": 2025, "keywords": ["manuka", "honey", "melanoma", "cell", "effects", "growth", "proliferation", "potential"], "source": "Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv", "slug": "the-effects-of-manuka-honey-on-melanoma-cell-growth-and-proliferation"}}

Urban forests have emerged as habitats that can balance the negative effect of urbanization on diversity, and reptiles and amphibians are considered model organisms for studying ecological and evolutionary patterns, including ecosystem health and function in natural and urban areas. Here, we set out to understand the community composition of the AUM forest herpetofauna, as well as its genetic diversity under different management treatments (invasive species removal, prescribed burns, prairie habitat, and control). In this presentation, we will summarize the results of our first year of sampling the Long-Term Ecological Research Experiment (LTERE) studying herp diversity in the AUM forest using 40 pit-fall trap surveys.

While cell-cell fusion occurs as a normal and essential cellular process, aberrant cell fusion has been linked to metastasis. The fusion of tumor cells with monocytes may enhance the metastatic potential due to changes in gene expression patterns in hybrids, generating cells that are both motile and capable of continuous cell division. Much remains unknown about the post-hybridization gene activation events leading to this phenotype. The mechanisms by which hybrid cells activate genes that enhance cell migration remain unresolved and is an important area for further investigation. To conduct these investigations, it is necessary to first establish a hybrid model. The monocyte cell line RAW264.7 was transfected to express GFP (RAW-GFP) and resistance to G418, and the colorectal cancer cell line MC-38, transfected to express RFP (MC-38-RFP) and resistance to blasticidin. Cells were cocultured under various conditions, including those that replicate the tumor microenvironment, and hybrids selected in media containing both G418 and blasticidin.

However, this method is often limited when dealing with remote homologs with low sequence similarity (<30%), where structural information provides a more reliable metric for assessing protein relationships. Existing structural alignment tools require either experimentally determined structures or computationally intensive structure predictions, making large-scale (e.g., metagenomic) structural similarity searches challenging. Methods: Our work introduces a deep learning-based approach that enables the prediction of structural similarity scores directly from sequence pairs. The model is trained using a twin neural network architecture to approximate structure-based alignment scores, allowing for efficient indexing, and querying of large protein sequence databases. By transforming protein sequences into vector representations that encode structural features, our approach facilitates rapid structural similarity searches without the need for explicit structure computation. Results: Our method significantly improves sensitivity in detecting remote homologs compared to traditional or recent AI-based sequence alignment techniques. Benchmarking on multiple protein structure databases demonstrates that it achieves high accuracy in predicting structural similarity, even for proteins with minimal sequence identity. Additionally, our approach scales efficiently, allowing for rapid and accurate searches across large protein sequence datasets.

Carbon can be incorporated into biomass, can be sedimented at the bottom of the ocean, or can be in the atmosphere as CO2, making the Earth warmer along with other greenhouse gasses. Studying the oceans is crucial because that’s where half of the Earth’s photosynthesis happens; and in particular studying bacteria in the ocean is of extreme importance because they drive key steps in the carbon cycle. The bacteria Ruegeria pomeroyi is emerging as a model organism to understand carbon flux in the ocean. Ruegeria pomeroyi has a published genome and is easy to grow in the lab; colleagues from UGA have been researching this organism from +20 years, and have developed ~4000 lines of mutants along with lab protocols for the discovery of genes that regulate metabolite uptake. In this work we describe the results of a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience that was conducted in Spring 2025 at Auburn University at Montgomery. In this study, we grew ~ 20 mutant R. pomeroyi bacteria that have unique disruptions in transporter genes for which the substrate taken up by the transporter is unknown, on a variety of substrates.

Ro\nDepartment: Chemistry\nCategory: Graduate Independent\nYear: 2025\n\nAbstract:\nSestrins, proteins that accumulates in cells exposed to environmental or genotoxic stress, play an important role in cell health, protecting tissues from damage or death by removing reactive oxygen species and inhibiting mTORC1 to induce autophagy. Arsenic is an environmental pollutant and is classified as class 1A carcinogen. One member of the Sestrin family, Sestrin2, also plays a role in inducing autophagy, clearance of damaged proteins and organelles, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis and integrity. However, while the molecular mechanism by which Sestrin2 induces autophagy in cells and tissues has been studied, how it induces autophagy against arsenic-induced toxicity is significantly less understood. Given the importance of cellular homeostasis in controlling redox status and energy metabolism, it is important that this knowledge gap be filled. The goal of this project is to determine the novel defense mechanisms by which Sestrins protect mammalian cells through autophagy induction caused by arsenic induced oxidative stress. Our central hypothesis is that the ULK1/Sestrin2 complex is activated by arsenic-induced oxidative stress, and that it induces autophagy, thus preventing further oxidative damage, improving cell metabolism. The following research questions will be pursued to test this hypothesis: 1) Are Sestrin2 and ULK1 robustly induced by ROS causing- arsenic? 2) How Sestrin2 regulates the gene and protein expressions of autophagy pathway? 3) Does the induction of Sestrin2 useful for autophagy activity, recycling of damaged protein? We will utilize western blotting, qRT PCR and immunofluorescence techniques in wild type and Sestrin2- manipulated mammalian cells to investigate the protective roles of autophagy process against arsenic induced toxicity. The work proposed here will shed new light on the physiological roles of Sestrin2 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and in protecting cells against arsenic induced oxidative stress and its associated metabolic disease.", "metadata": {"title": "PROTECTIVE ROLE OF MAMMALIAN SESTRIN2 AGAINST ARSENIC-INDUCED CYTOTOXICITY", "lead_presenters": ["Michkayla Prince", "Colby Tillman"], "other_authors": ["Mason McCollister"], "mentor": "David S.

Understanding factors that contribute to their rapid range expansion can substantially improve our ability to prevent and control their spread. We used digital natural history collections data, (i.e. herbarium data from iDigBio, citizen science observations from GBIF) to compare the rate of range expansion of three invasive species Ligustrum sinense (Chinese privet), Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle) and Imperata cylindrica (Cogon grass) in North America. Privet and honeysuckle are escaped ornamental plants in the US, as their seeds are spread by birds. Cogon grass was introduced as forage and seeds are wind dispersed. We hypothesized that the wind pollinated and wind dispersed Cogon grass spreads more rapidly compared to Chinese privet and Japanese honeysuckle which both rely on insect pollinators and animals for seed disperal. We used QGIS to map species occurrences in North America and calculated the range expansion for all three species using 20-year intervals. Using covariance analysis, we tested the rate of range expansion. Our results showed that Chinese privet had the fastest range expansion, while range expansion rates did not differ significantly between Cogon grass and Japanese honeysuckle. Our study also showed that the range expansion rate for Chinese privet increased significantly 80 years post introduction, indicating that monitoring the range expansion of potential invasive species via natural history collections could be an important early warning tool to identify invasive species that require implementation of large-scale distribution restrictions.", "metadata": {"title": "USING NATURAL HISTORY COLLECTIONS TO ASSESS FACTORS INFLUENCING RANGE EXPANSION OF INVASIVE PLANTS IN THE UNITED STATES", "lead_presenters": ["Brittney Smith"], "other_authors": ["Braxton Talbot", "Kailey Higgins"], "mentor": "Claudia Stein", "department": "Biology and Environmental Science", "category": "Undergraduate Course-Based", "year": 2025, "keywords": ["expansion", "range", "invasive", "species", "chinese", "cogon", "assess", "influencing"], "source": "Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv", "slug": "using-natural-history-collections-to-assess-factors-influencing-range-expansion-"}}

Identifying the attributes that allow invasives to expand their ranges is imperative to preventing and controlling their spread. We used digital natural history collections data, (herbarium data, citizen science observations) to compare the rate of range expansion of two noxious invasive plants, Pueraria montana (kudzu), and Sorghum halepense (johnsongrass) in North America. Both are fast-growing herbaceous perennials that spread rapidly via rhizomes or tuberous roots. They were introduced to North America as livestock feed and soil erosion control in the mid-19th century. Johnsongrass, is wind-pollinated and produces vast numbers of viable seeds easily spread by birds, mixed in baled hay, and on agricultural equipment. Kudzu, a climbing vine in the family Fabaceae, is extremely fast growing, girdles trees and shrubs, and its large trifoliate leaves shade out most understory species. However, kudzu has very low seed viability, possibly due to missing pollinators. We hypothesized that johnsongrass will invade faster due to the sheer number of viable seeds and how easily they are spread. Using QGIS we mapped species occurrences in North America, calculated the range expansion for both species using 20-year intervals. Using covariance analysis, we tested the rate of range expansion. We showed that Johnsongrass did indeed spread faster and had a much larger invasive range over time, leading us to conclude that seed viability and dispersal in this comparison overcame impressive vegetative growth.", "metadata": {"title": "SEED PRODUCTION NOT FAST VEGETATIVE GROWTH DRIVES RAPID RANGE EXPANSION", "lead_presenters": ["J Myles Wright"], "other_authors": [], "mentor": "Claudia Stein", "department": "Biology and Environmental Science", "category": "Undergraduate Course-Based", "year": 2025, "keywords": ["production", "drives", "rapid", "non-native", "range", "spread", "north", "america"], "source": "Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv", "slug": "seed-production-not-fast-vegetative-growth-drives-rapid-range-expansion"}}

Leaman1 and Haewon An2\nDepartment: 1Biology and Environmental Sciences and 2Chemistry\nCategory: Undergraduate oral abstracts\nYear: 2024\n\nAbstract:\nInfectious Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHNV) is a member of the Rhabdoviridae family that causes severe viral infection and disease in salmonids. During viral infection, the innate immune system is activated, including upregulation of type I interferons that mediate antiviral responses. We’ve shown that Rhabdoviral matrix protein (M) plays an important role in blocking cellular gene expression, and thus innate immune responses, by inhibiting host RNA polymerase II. IHNV M protein N-terminal deletions of greater than five amino acids (∆5N, ∆10N, ∆20N) resulted in loss of protein stability/detection, and loss of anti-transcriptional activity. Interestingly, concomitant deletions at the C-terminus (i.e. ∆5NC, ∆10NC, ∆20NC) restored M protein detection and/or anti-transcriptional activity. We hypothesized that M half-life is regulated via an interplay the N- and C-termini such that protein ubiquitination within the C-terminus is prevented by interference by N-terminal residues that, when deleted, results in rapid protein degradation. Potential Lysine ubiquitination sites in the C-terminus were mutated to assess M protein structural stability. Point mutations of three lysines in the C-terminus (K190/193/195A) blocked M instability associated with N-terminus deletions (∆5N and ∆10N) in a manner that was similar to that observed with the ∆5NC, ∆10NC, ∆20NC variants. These results strongly suggested that these residues are target sites for M protein ubiquitination, and thus impact M stability. Ongoing studies will assess direct ubiquitination of M on the implicated lysines. Future goals are to develop attenuated viral vaccine candidates involving targeted mutations within M to allow infected hosts to mount a better antiviral response.", "metadata": {"title": "STRUCTURE-FUNCTION RELATIONSHIP OF INFECTIOUS HEMATOPOIETIC NECROSIS VIRUS MATRIX (M) PROTEIN: ELUCIDATION OF THE ROLES OF CONSERVED RESIDUES IN HOST ANTIVIRAL RESPONSES", "lead_presenters": ["Kaleb Beasley and Lama Farris"], "other_authors": ["Shelbi Rall", "Jeffrey Ringiesn"], "mentor": "Douglas W.

The current research focused on whether monetary cost of food was associated with preference for foods that may be immediately reinforcing but have negative health effects in the long term. Participants were randomly placed into one of three conditions: Higher energy-dense foods priced higher than lower energy-dense foods, higher energy-dense foods priced less than lower energy-dense foods, and higher energy-dense foods priced the same as lower energy-dense foods. Via computer task, participants were presented with multiple simultaneous discriminations between two food items (one low and one high energy-dense) and allowed to select which they preferred. Following the food choice portion of the task, participants were asked to report their food security status, Body Mass Index (BMI), and their gender identification. The relationships between food choices and food price, food choices and food security, food choices and BMI, and food choices and gender identification will be discussed.", "metadata": {"title": "THE EFFECTS OF PRICE AND FOOD SECURITY ON NUTRITIONAL CHOICES", "lead_presenters": ["Ay’lanna Turner and Charlesea Witherington"], "other_authors": ["Christopher Alex Ennis"], "mentor": "Jessica Stagner Bodily", "department": "Psychology", "category": "Undergraduate oral abstracts", "year": 2024, "keywords": ["food", "energy-dense", "foods", "higher", "choices", "lower", "nutritional", "effects"], "source": "Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv", "slug": "the-effects-of-price-and-food-security-on-nutritional-choices"}}

Our preliminary dataset comprises of 28 parent hyperspectral images (HSIs), each a substantial unlabelled image measuring 5000x1500 pixels. With the meteorological expertise within our project team, we hand-labeled pixels by extracting 10 to 20 sample patches from each parent image, each patch consisting of a 50x50 pixel field. This process yielded a collection of 380 patches, each categorically labeled into one of seven cloud and sky condition categories. Aiming to embed the inherent data structure while classifying individual pixels, we introduced an innovative technique to boost classification accuracy by incorporating patch-specific information directly into each pixel's feature vector. This enhancement involved calculating dense coding for patch membership and training a suite of binary classifiers—one for each bit of the dense code—resulting in an enriched 462-dimensional feature vector augmented with our embedding algorithm for patch identification. The posterior probabilities generated by these classifiers, which capture the unique attributes of each patch, were subsequently concatenated with the pixel’s original spectral data to form an augmented feature vector. We then applied various machine learning algorithms to classify pixels, comparing the results with a baseline model devoid of patch-origin embedding. The results show that incorporating the spatial context along with the the spectral information inherent in hyperspectral images enhances the classification accuracy in hyperspectral cloud classification.", "metadata": {"title": "ENHANCING CLOUD CLASSIFICATION IN HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGERY THROUGH PATCH-ORIGIN EMBEDDING AND MACHINE LEARNING", "lead_presenters": ["Rachel Zheng", "Brandon Phillip Boehm"], "other_authors": [], "mentor": "Hua Yan1, Randy Russell2, Olcay Kursun1", "department": "1Department of Computer and Computer Information Systems and 2Department of Chemistry", "category": "Undergraduate oral abstracts", "year": 2024, "keywords": ["hyperspectral", "enhancing", "pika", "classification", "imagery", "resonon", "cloud", "image"], "source": "Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv", "slug": "enhancing-cloud-classification-in-hyperspectral-imagery-through-patch-origin-emb"}}

Kiefer, Benedict C. Okeke\nMentor: Claudia Stein\nDepartment: Biology & Environmental Sciences, College of Sciences\nCategory: Undergraduate poster abstracts\nYear: 2024\n\nAbstract:\nThe invasive legume kudzu (Pueriara montana var. lobata) is one of the fastest growing and most noxious invasive plants in the US. The roots of legumes are associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and with rhizobia, which are nitrogen fixating bacteria located in the root nodules. Results from previous experiments indicate that these root endophytes associated with kudzu can have a growth promoting effect on some plant species, such as graminoids, while strongly suppressing the growth of other species, such as legume species native to grassland systems in Alabama. These results support the hypothesis that soil microbial effects are species specific and that different root endophytes might be at play. We performed inoculation experiments in the greenhouse to assess the potential of specific strains of root endophytes (rhizobia and other growth promoting bacteria) isolated from kudzu to improve plant growth of different crop species. Preliminary results indicate that germination rates of crop species belonging to the poaceae increase when inoculated with a bacterial strain isolated from kudzu roots. In contrast, the isolated rhizobial strain did not affect germination rates of the legumes. Our results suggest, that specific root endophytic strains from kudzu have plant promoting properties and might be useful for the development of biofertilizers. Sustainably promoting agricultural productivity is crucial to support our growing human population. The use of biofertilizer is one practice that is more beneficial to plant and soil health compared to chemical fertilizers.", "metadata": {"title": "THE POWER OF KUDZU - IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC ROOT ENDOPHYTES TO PROMOTE CROP PRODUCTIVITY", "lead_presenters": ["Rachel Davenport"], "other_authors": ["Robert W.

L-asparaginase is a valuable enzyme used for the treatment of lymphoblastic leukemia (a type of cancer), prevention of acrylamide formation in heat processed foods and development of biosensor for asparagine. In our previous work, we demonstrated production of L-asparaginase in liquid culture by bacteria and fungi isolated from soil environments. Our present work focuses on molecular characterization of selected L-asparaginase producing bacteria and fungi using 16s ribosomal RNA gene and ITS DNA sequences, respectively. Purified PCR amplicons of 16s rRNA gene and ITS DNA were sequenced. GenBank Blast was used for homology and phylogenetic analysis. Bacterial isolate B1-6 was found to be most closely related to Paraburkholderia caribensis strain MNL-133 (100% homology). B1-7 is most closely related to Pseudomonas mosselii strain ABAP1 (99.88% homology). B1-10 was found to be related to Priestia megaterium strain W1156 (99.89% homology), whereas the closest match for BF1-10 was Sporosarcina luteola strain EB270 (99.55% homology). For our fungal isolates, F1-1 displayed 99.36% homology to Mucor circinelloides UWR_148. F1-7 is most closely related to Mucor circinelloides isolate FD (98.98 % homology), F2-3 showed 99.82 % homology to Mucor janssenii culture CBS:227.29.

Positive reinforcement and token economies are a reinforcement system in which the learner earns tokens that can be traded in for desired reinforcers, are commonly used in educational settings to shape and maintain positive classroom behaviors. By the time students reach college, the type of reinforcement used by instructors is likely to be both qualitatively and quantitatively different from what students may have experienced early in their education. The current study conducted two experiments that both employed an ABAB design to examine the effect of a token economy on classroom participation. Undergraduate students enrolled in a college course at AUM were recruited as participants and were given a data sheet each day that instructed them to mark the sheet each time they participated. During \"A\" phases, participation was recorded. During \"B\" phases, participation was recorded, and participants could exchange three marks for a reward. Reward options included candy, school supplies, and various \"play items.” Results of the first experiment suggest that participation increased when reinforcement was available, while results of the second experiment suggest that participation did not increase when reinforcement was available.

The presence of Escherichia coli and other coliform bacteria in water indicates potential contamination by pathogens, as these bacteria originate from the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and animals. Coliforms are essential indicators of water quality, with contamination sources including sewage and fecal matter. Traditional methods for identifying coliform colonies on agar plates are time-consuming and costly, involving biochemical and molecular techniques. This research introduces an approach using two open-source image processing tools, ImageJ for image analysis and OpenCV for computer vision tasks, integrating machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to streamline the analysis of E. coli and Citrobacter freundii colonies. While ImageJ assists in basic image processing and analysis, our focus on OpenCV includes exploring advanced preprocessing techniques. In this research, we used image binarization to convert images into binary images, blurring and connected component analysis to reduce noise, and the Hough Transform for circle detection. These preprocessing techniques are followed by ML classifiers such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for predicting the presence of specific pathogens based on colony radii and shape descriptors. In our study, we analyzed two images, each containing multiple colonies of Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii. Using the two alternative methods, ImageJ and OpenCV, we detected colonies for the two distinct classes. We obtained over 90% accuracy through leave-one-out cross-validation. The proposed method is a potential rapid and cost-effective alternative for pathogen detection in water resources.", "metadata": {"title": "EXPLORATION OF IMAGE PROCESSING AND COMPUTER VISON FOR RECOGNITION OF COLONIES OF COLIFORM BACTERIA IN WATER QUALITY ANALYSIS", "lead_presenters": ["Abria Gates", "Torry Wilson"], "other_authors": [], "mentor": "Olcay Kursun1 and Benedict Okeke2", "department": "1Computer and Computer Information Systems and 2Biology and Environmental Science", "category": "Undergraduate poster abstracts", "year": 2024, "keywords": ["bacteria", "water", "exploration", "colonies", "vison", "recognition", "image", "analysis"], "source": "Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv", "slug": "exploration-of-image-processing-and-computer-vison-for-recognition-of-colonies-o"}}

Carbon can be incorporated into biomass, can be sedimented at the bottom of the ocean, or can be in the atmosphere as CO2, making the Earth warmer along with other greenhouse gasses. Studying the oceans is crucial because that’s where half of the Earth’s photosynthesis happens; and in particular studying bacteria in the ocean is of extreme importance because they drive key steps in the carbon cycle. The bacteria Ruegeria pomeroyi is emerging as a model organism to understand carbon flux in the ocean. Ruegeria pomeroyi has a published genome and is easy to grow in the lab; colleges from UGA have been researching this organism from +20 years, and have developed ~4000 lines of mutants along with lab protocols for the discovery of genes that regulate metabolite uptake. In this work we describe the results of a Course-based Undergraduate Research Course that was conducting in Spring 2024 at Auburn University at Montgomery. In this study, we grew ~ 20 mutant R. pomeroyi bacteria that have unique disruptions in transporter genes for which the substrate taken up by the transporter is unknown, on a variety of substrates.

The dataset encompasses 195 voice recordings represented by 22 voice measures (e.g., jitter, shimmer, and formants) obtained from these subjects. A common approach with such datasets involves applying ML classifiers directly to individual recordings, often employing leave-one-group-out cross-validation to ensure that samples from the same individual are exclusively in either the training set or the test set, but not both. Alternatively, classifiers may be applied to features aggregated across an individual's voice samples (to encapsulate the variability and central tendencies of the voice measurements), utilizing statistical measures like the mean, maximum, and minimum for each feature, followed by leave-one-out cross-validation. However, these strategies fail to take full advantage of the group membership. We propose an embedding technique that incorporates the group membership for voice recordings through a classifier whose posterior probabilities serve as representations of the individual's vocal biomarkers, which are then concatenated with the original voice measures, crafting an augmented feature vector for each recording. Our findings, which extend the pioneering algorithm developed by our hyperspectral imaging group, underscore that incorporating individual-specific context significantly boosts classification accuracy.

Auburn University in Montgomery (AUM) is located in the city of Montgomery and has a ~250-acre secondary urban forest. Urban forests have emerged as habitats that can balance the negative effect of urbanization on diversity, and reptiles and amphibians are considered model organisms for studying ecological and evolutionary patterns, including ecosystem health and function in natural and urban areas. Here, we set out to understand the community composition of the AUM forest herpetofauna, as well as its genetic diversity under different management treatments (invasive species removal, prescribed burns, prairie habitat, and control). In this presentation, we will present the results of our first year of sampling the Long-Term Ecological Research Experiment (LTERE) studying herp diversity in the AUM forest using pit-fall trap surveys. So far, we have installed 8 functional traps in the forest and have undergo 13 periods (5 days each) of sampling. Specimens are identified, measured, and released. Our study will allow us to make recommendations regarding conservation, preservation, and management of habitats.

Koelling, Claudia Stein\nDepartment: Biology and Environmental Science\nCategory: Undergraduate poster abstracts\nYear: 2024\n\nAbstract:\nHerbaria represent important repositories of historical biodiversity information and with increasing digitization of these collections data are easily available to the global scientific community. Many herbaria are collected at smaller institutions where most specimens are collected by amateur botanists, plant enthusiasts, or students who have to complete an assignment. We predict that specimens mainly collected by non-experts will be a valuable resource to assess the distribution of nonnative and invasive plants, and thus could be used as an early warning system for invasive species in a region. We digitized AUM’s 42-year-old herbarium collection of about 1,500 specimens. The value of AUM’s collection lays in the fact that 40% of the specimen were repeatedly collected from the same locality in different years, allowing us to assess changes in plant morphological traits, such as leaf size and plant height over time. About 25% of the collection consist of specimen nonnative to the southeastern US. By comparing current specimens with historical collections, we can assess changes in plant populations, track the spread of invasive species, and evaluate the impact of environmental changes on plant diversity. This information is crucial for making informed decisions for implementing effective conservation measures.

Extending the applicability of ZKP protocols to high-dimensional data scenarios, our approach addresses the critical challenge of securely assessing word embeddings' quality while preserving data privacy. The protocol begins with Victor, the verifier, utilizing TF*IDF and logistic regression to determine important words representative of various contexts. Once identified, Victor securely transmits these words to Peggy, the prover, who applies Word2Vec (W2V) embeddings and masks them using the ZKP protocol. Peggy then securely transmits the masked embeddings back to Victor. Upon receiving the masked embeddings, Victor employs a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to evaluate their quality. Leveraging SVM's capability for effective separation of embeddings belonging to different contexts, Victor ensures the reliability of Peggy's embeddings without compromising data privacy. Furthermore, we address the challenge of nonlinear separability in embedding space induced by the mod operation by employing polar coordinates, ensuring that the embeddings accurately capture semantic meanings even in masked vector spaces. Our proposed algorithm offers a robust and privacy-preserving method for evaluating word embeddings, facilitating secure assessments in high-dimensional spaces for NLP applications.

However, a current gap exists in the form of the lack of user-friendly software tools tailored for newcomers to this field. This study introduces GoFold, a novel, standalone graphical user interface (GUI) designed for beginners to perform contact map overlap (CMO) problems for better template selection. While many existing tools cater more to research needs or assume foundational knowledge, GoFold stands out by offering an intuitive, user-friendly platform with comprehensive tutorials. With its ability to visually represent the CMO problem, it allows users to input proteins in various formats and explore the CMO problem. The educational value of GoFold is demonstrated through benchmarking against the state-of-the-art contact map overlap method, map_align, using two datasets: PSICOV and CAMEO. GoFold exhibits superior performance in terms of TM-score and Z-score metrics across diverse qualities of contact maps and target difficulties.

Research has found that perceptions of a more positive racial climate, increased support from educators, increased interracial interactions, and a stronger sense of school belonging resulted in increased levels of academic curiosity and academic persistence for young Black girls (Butler-Barnes et al., 2018). While it is difficult to be noted as a high-achieving Black student, research has found that it is achievable if they receive support and positivity from their school and administration (Butler-Barnes, et al., 2018). As research examining the effects of ERI and resilience on academic engagement has mainly focused on Black children within the K 12 system, the current study extends the findings to the higher education setting by examining the effects on college students. College educators are often not required to learn multiculturalism or diversity to teach in higher education despite it being important to understand the backgrounds of students to help better further the learning process.

Because of the advancement of Internet technologies, security threats to networks and IT infrastructure are always changing. One such serious problem is scamming, in which hackers attempt to obtain users’ login information by using phony mail, bogus websites, or both. Businesses and academic organizations place high importance on developing defenses against phishing scams. Therefore, companies must place a high priority on end-user training while taking precautions against phishing dangers. In this research, we clone a popular website to place a phishing attack on a user. This paper has a high impact because we have mirrored highly secure web pages that use form validation for security. Once users come across our duplicate web page, they get fooled by the phishing portal and enter their secret information. Now the attacker uses this information to commit bigger crimes.

Cargile and Elizabeth Buchli\nOther Authors: —\nMentor: Rolando N. Carol and Jessica Stagner Bodily\nDepartment: Psychology\nCategory: —\nYear: 2023\n\nAbstract:\nAn extensive body of research on eyewitness decision making shows that witnesses who choose quickly are more likely to be accurate than witnesses who spend more time choosing. A rapid lineup choice is likely the product of witnesses having a recognition experience, that is, a quick, “pop out” effect when the witness sees the familiar face, (i.e. the perpetrator of the crime). Additionally, the instructions that witnesses receive before a lineup task can impact their accuracy, by increasing the likelihood of choosing an innocent suspect, for instance. The present study investigated the potential impact of a novel lineup instruction on mock witnesses’ lineup choices; specifically, an instruction that teaches witnesses about evidence-based indicators of eyewitness accuracy like decision speed and experiencing a “pop out” effect. Participants (N= 450) viewed a mock crime video and were then randomly assigned to one of the following three instruction groups: (1) Instructions that educate them about eyewitness recognition memory, (called “Recognition instruction group”) (2) “Take as much time as you need to look at each photograph”, and (3) a control group, who received no additional instructions. Next, participants were presented with a simultaneous photo lineup, which was either target\u0002present or target-absent. Then, participants answered various questions about their lineup decision and confidence. Our primary hypothesis was not supported as participants in the recognition instructions group were not more likely than the other groups to reject a target-absent lineup. However, we did find that participants who received the recognition instructions were significantly more likely to report having a “pop-out” experience than participants in the other groups. Additionally, participants who reported having a “pop-out” recognition experience were significantly more likely to be accurate in their choices than those who did not report the same experience. Further, and consistent with prior research, higher confidence was a significant predictor of accuracy for those who viewed a target-present lineup; that is, witnesses who were more confident in their choice were more likely to be accurate than those who were less confident in their choices. Lastly, faster identifications were significantly more likely to be accurate than slower identifications.", "metadata": {"title": "THE IMPACT OF RECOGNITION MEMORY INSTRUCTIONS ON EYEWITNESS LINEUP CHOICES", "lead_presenters": ["Jordan L.

Positive reinforcement and token economies, or a reinforcement system in which the learner earns tokens that can be traded in for desired reinforcers, are commonly used in educational settings to shape and maintain positive classroom behaviors.

Undergraduate participants were given an online questionnaire inquiring about their food preferences. Specifically, participants were asked over a series of 20 questions to choose between two food items, one more and one less calorically dense. In addition, body state satisfaction ratings and attitudes regarding body positivity were collected. Participants were separated into two groups, those indicating that their BMI was under 25, or in a medically healthy range, and those indicating their BMI was over 25, or a medically unhealthy range. Participants with a BMI of over 25 were more likely to choose more calorically dense food items and report higher body state satisfaction than participants with a BMI of under 25. Moreover, white participants reported higher body state satisfaction and scored higher on attitudes towards body positivity than African American/Black participants. Lastly, participants identifying as male scored higher in attitudes towards body positivity than female-identifying participants. These findings support that BMI is correlated with food choices, body state satisfaction, and future body goals.

In contrast to RGB images, hyperspectral images contain a large number of wavelength bands and the bands do not overlap. The Resonon PIKA XC2 hyperspectral camera used in this study for imaging sky and clouds has a spectral resolution of only 1.3 nm and produces spectra with 462 bands. Segmentation of these hyperspectral images of sky/clouds is an important step in studying the scattering of sunlight by clouds; however, it is also a laborious and challenging task unless automatic feature selection and clustering algorithms are applied. Machine-learning-based clustering algorithms can be used to segment the images into similarity-based chunks of pixels, while the feature selection algorithms can be used to make sure that the bands with redundant information are discarded while the clustering results are maximally preserved. In the study, we used sequential feature selection to pick the best bands, kmeans clustering for segmentation, and rand-index for cluster validity index. Our results show that the wavelength region 741 – 758 nm (bands 267 – 280) might a good choice for clustering since wavelengths in that region are frequently selected at some stage in the sequential feature selection process.", "metadata": {"title": "IMPACT OF FEATURE SELECTION ON HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGE SEGMENTATION", "lead_presenters": ["Ryan Vales"], "other_authors": ["Ben Nguyen"], "mentor": "Randy Russell and Olcay Kursun", "department": "Department of Chemistry and Department of Computer Science", "category": "", "year": 2023, "keywords": ["hyperspectral", "feature", "impact", "selection", "bands", "images", "clustering", "segmentation"], "source": "Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv", "slug": "impact-of-feature-selection-on-hyperspectral-image-segmentation"}}

Florencia Breitman and Justin C. Bagley\nDepartment: Biology and Environmental Science\nCategory: —\nYear: 2023\n\nAbstract:\nAlabama has a rich and diverse herpetofauna with ~166 species and the highest diversity in the Southeastern Coastal Plain (SCP) biodiversity ‘hotspot’. Many of these species are now threatened or endangered because of the impacts of urbanization and other human activities. Auburn University in Montgomery (AUM) is located in the city of Montgomery and has a ~250-acre secondary urban forest. Urban forests have emerged as habitats that can balance the negative effect of urbanization on diversity, and reptiles and amphibians are considered model organisms for studying ecological and evolutionary patterns, including ecosystem health and function in natural and urban areas. Here, we set out to understand the community composition of the AUM forest herpetofauna, as well as its genetic diversity under different management treatments (invasive species removal, prescribed burns, prairie habitat, and control). In this presentation, we will give the first update on construction of the Long-Term Ecological Research Experiment (LTERE) studying herp diversity in the AUM forest using pit-fall trap surveys.

One factor that can affect species diversity is the preference of herbivores feeding on specific plant species in the ecosystem. In forest ecosystems, the effects of deer on plant diversity are well-studied. However, the impact of snails is often overlooked. Snails are similar to deer generalist herbivores that feed on multiple plant species. We hypothesize that snails are selective about which plant species they prefer to eat and that selective feeding preferences determine which plant seedlings can establish in an ecosystem. We work with terrestrial snails native to AL ecosystems. In our project, we will be using lab and field experiments to test how snail feeding preferences for different native and non-native plant species can impact plant species composition in forest ecosystems in Alabama.", "metadata": {"title": "DOES SNAIL PREFERENCE TO NON-NATIVE PLANTS IN ALABAMA HAVE AN EFFECT ON PLANT DIVERSITY?", "lead_presenters": ["Brittney Smith"], "other_authors": ["Ana Segarra and Kiara Warren"], "mentor": "Claudia Stein", "department": "Department of Biology and Environmental Science", "category": "", "year": 2023, "keywords": ["plant", "diversity", "species", "snails", "ecosystems", "feeding", "non-native", "alabama"], "source": "Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv", "slug": "does-snail-preference-to-non-native-plants-in-alabama-have-an-effect-on-plant-di"}}

While the disease can be associated with certain genetic mutations, familial Parkinsonism constitutes only about 10% of all cases. To date, aging remains the main risk factor of the disease, but the causative relationship is elusive. Notably, accumulation of damage to the mitochondrial genome is a hallmark of aging tissues, and often coincides with the development of Parkinson’s disease. We hypothesize that aging-related accumulation of mitochondrial defects enables the onset of the disease. To evaluate that, we will test whether a prevention of mtDNA damage in dopaminergic neurons can preclude their loss. Thus far, we established that accumulation of mtDNA defects can be prevented by increasing the intracellular level of a molecular chaperone Tid1. Currently, we are working towards differentiation of control and Tid1 overexpressing cell lines into dopaminergic neurons. Once successful, we will compare their susceptibility to mtDNA damage.", "metadata": {"title": "THE ROLE OF DEFECTS TO THE MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF PARKINSON’S DISEASE", "lead_presenters": ["Lama Fariss"], "other_authors": ["Monia Yousef and Noelle Kim"], "mentor": "Elena J.

To study the population genetics of these species, we need to be able to isolate high quality DNA. Within genus Rhododendron, secondary compounds appear to bind to the DNA and are not filtered out thoroughly through standard CTAB isolation methods. We tested nine different modifications to the CTAB isolation method to try and improve the quality and yield of DNA from Rhododendron prunifolium. We observed no significant improvement in the 260/280 ratio, 260/230 ratio, or concentration of DNA with any of these modifications, although we did observe that some modifications significantly worsened the 260/230 ratio. Overall, there was no modification that significantly improved the quality and yield of DNA for this species.

Koelling\nDepartment: Biology and Environmental Science\nCategory: —\nYear: 2023\n\nAbstract:\nInvasive plant species represent a major threat to native ecosystems. They reduce native biodiversity, disrupt nutrient cycles, habitat structure, food webs and microbial communities above- and belowground. Kudzu, Pueraria montana var. lobata, is one of the fastest growing and most noxious invasive plants in the US. As a legume, it has a strong influence not only on carbon and nitrogen dynamics but likely also on the composition of soil microbial communities. Recent studies suggest that alterations to the soil microbial community can hinder the successful establishment of desired native plant species that often require specific soil microorganisms, such as mutualistic mycorrhizal fungi, rhizobia, and other endophytic bacteria. In a greenhouse study, we showed that kudzu creates positive feedbacks via changes in the soil microbial communities that might further foster its invasion success. Soil microbes associated with kudzu suppress the growth of the native legume Chamaecrista fasciculata but are beneficial for kudzu itself. However, we do not know the identity of the microbes causing these drastic growth effects, limiting our ability to apply soil inoculations to increase restoration success. The increasing availability of novel molecular tools helps us to better explore soil microbial communities. To address this issue, we extracted soil DNA from the above-mentioned greenhouse experiment. Using these DNA samples, we will amplify four target regions using PCR. Each of these target regions is used to identify operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for a target group of microbes. Upon receiving results from our sequencing, we will analyze these data to sort sequences from the eight soil samples into OTUs, and test whether the soil microbial communities from the invaded vs. uninvaded soil are distinct from one another.", "metadata": {"title": "A COMPARISON OF THE SOIL MICROBIOME BETWEEN KUDZU-INVADED AND UNINVADED AREAS", "lead_presenters": ["Samuel C.

Here, we present an overview and preliminary results from the start of a two-year field study of population dynamics and sex ratios from 6 native G. affinis populations in Central Alabama. We have begun using mark–recapture experiments to tag G. affinis with visible implant elastomer (VIE) tags and estimate the sizes and sex ratios of multiple study populations. During procedures, specimens are measured (standard length and total length), sexed (male, female, and juvenile), and tagged, and habitat characteristics are recorded. We show that our preliminary results are consistent with a priori expectations under our hypotheses (1) that G. affinis population dynamics will exhibit asynchronous numerical dynamics in the study area, and (2) that sex ratios will be female-biased, in general, irrespective of absolute differences in population sizes. Our study will provide the first data on inter-annual patterns of variation in G. affinis from Alabama, and it will also permit greater understanding of the demographic features of native G. affinis populations, including the above parameters as well as mortality rates in the wild.", "metadata": {"title": "POPULATION DYNAMICS AND SEX RATIOS OF WESTERN MOSQUITOFISH (GAMBUSIA AFFINIS: POECILIIDAE) IN CENTRAL ALABAMA", "lead_presenters": ["Kailey Higgins"], "other_authors": [], "mentor": "Justin C.

Matrix composition or hostility is an important component of a landscape and can have profound effects on species movement and boundary behavior, persistence of a single species, and coexistence of interacting species. We model a system of two competitors dwelling in the same remnant patch surrounded by a hostile matrix. In this case, one competitor is being harvested (direct effect) and the other is not being harvested but is disrupted by the harvesting process, causing increased emigration (indirect effect). Thus, the second competitor exhibits a positive relationship between harvesting effort and emigration, i.e., harvesting-mediated emigration. In this talk, we will introduce our modeling framework and share some recent results demonstrating that community structure can be altered because of harvesting-mediated emigration and habitat fragmentation.", "metadata": {"title": "HARVESTING-MEDIATED EMIGRATION CAN AFFECT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN A COMPETITIVE SYSTEM.", "lead_presenters": ["Jacob Garrett and Savannah Humphries"], "other_authors": ["Hamza Abusammou"], "mentor": "Jerome Goddard II", "department": "Mathematics", "category": "", "year": 2023, "keywords": ["competitive", "emigration", "affect", "species", "community", "structure", "harvesting-mediated", "matrix"], "source": "Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv", "slug": "harvesting-mediated-emigration-can-affect-community-structure-in-a-competitive-s"}}

Consequently, damage to the mitochondrial genome results in energy deprivation, which may in turn onset human diseases. The so\u0002called primary deletions of mtDNA are the most common defects of the mitochondrial genome. Their accumulation underlays a number of human disorders, as well as natural human aging. The molecular basis of the deletions formation is, however, poorly understood, but it is evident that they result from perturbations of the mtDNA replication process. Interestingly, loss of a seemingly unrelated molecular chaperone, Tid1, results in accumulation of mtDNA deletions, which is suggestive of its role in the genome maintenance and prevention of the deletions formation. To test this, we blocked mtDNA replication in control and Tid1 overexpressing HeLa cell lines. This resulted in a dramatic accumulation of deletions in control cells but not in the cells harboring elevated levels of Tid1. Interestingly, Tid1 overexpressing cells exhibited ~3-fold higher basal level of mtDNA, which is indicative of its direct involvement in the mtDNA replication process. We are currently pursuing the role of Tid1 in mtDNA replication through in vitro studies.", "metadata": {"title": "MOLECULAR CHAPERONE TID1 PREVENTS FORMATION OF DELETIONS IN THE MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME", "lead_presenters": ["Monia Yousef"], "other_authors": ["Lama Farris", "Noelle Kim", "and Alexia Caldwell"], "mentor": "Elena J.

L-asparaginase has health-related applications. L-asparagine is an amino acid that human cells synthesize for use in protein synthesis. Lymphoblastic leukemia cells cannot synthesize L-asparagine and depend on L-asparagine present in the blood to synthesize proteins. L\u0002asparaginase can be used to deplete blood levels of L-asparagine and is hence deployed in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia among other uses. Acrylamide is a potential carcinogen and neurotoxin that can be formed through the reaction of asparagine with carbohydrates due to high temperatures in food processing. Asparaginases are also useful in food processing to reduce the heat-initiated accumulation of acrylamide. In this study we isolated asparaginase-producing microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) from soil environments using serial dilution and phenol red dye-based plate screening assay. Selected potential asparaginase producing bacteria and fungi were examined for asparaginase production in liquid submerged culture.

Previous work by our group indicated that, in the presence of conditioned media from insulin-resistant adipocytes (IRCM), both melanoma and breast cancer cells exhibit increased cell proliferation. This may be in part due to the increased use of fatty acids as sources of fuel, this was corroborated by the finding that genes for proteins involved in both cell proliferation and fatty acid oxidation were upregulated in cells exposed to IRCM, including PCNA, Ki67, ACOX, and CPT1. We sought to extrapolate these findings to ovarian cancer cells and investigate leptin’s role in the increased growth and altered cell metabolism.

There is increasing evidence that reactive oxygen species, mainly produced in mitochondrial activities in the human body, are involved in several inflammatory and degenerative diseases. In beverages, antioxidants are defined as substances that, in small quantities, are able to prevent or significantly reduce the oxidation of easily oxidizable fats as inhibitors. Measurement of antioxidant capacity was measured by suppressing Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in beverages by using ultrasonic irradiation to the commercial beverage-containing waters.

While cell-cell fusion occurs as a normal and essential cellular process, aberrant cell fusion has been linked to diseases including metastatic cancer. The cell fusion hypothesis was first put forward over 100 years ago by Professor Otto Aichel, a German pathologist, and has gained traction in recent years. The central tenet is that the fusion of tumor cells with bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) may enhance the metastatic potential of the tumor cells due to changes in the gene expression pattern in the fused cell resulting from the addition of the BMDC nucleus, thus generating cells that are both motile and capable of continuous cell division. While the hypothesis above provides a compelling theory for macrophage tumor fusions as potentiators of metastatic disease, still much remains unknown about the post\u0002hybridization gene activation driving events leading to this phenotype. The mechanisms by which hybrid cells activate genes that enhance cell migration remain unresolved and have been identified as an important area for investigation as a potential target for therapy. In order to conduct these investigations, it is necessary to first establish a model that can be utilized to conduct further investigations. Using the macrophage cell line RAW264.7, transfected to express GFP (RAW-GFP) and polarized to an M2 phenotype, and the colorectal cancer cell line HT-29, transfected to express RFP (HT-29 RFP) and subjected to hypoxia, this recreates conditions of the tumor microenvironment in which to generate cancer-macrophage fusion hybrids. Once the hybrids are established, we will then have a model in which to compare the phenotype and function of these cells to the parental tumor cells, HT-29 RFP.", "metadata": {"title": "DEVELOPMENT OF A MACROPHAGE-TUMOR FUSION MODEL", "lead_presenters": ["Samantha Mejia and Juan Rodriguez"], "other_authors": ["Aleah Wilson"], "mentor": "Ann Marie O’Neill", "department": "Biology and Environmental Science", "category": "", "year": 2023, "keywords": ["cell", "cells", "fusion", "tumor", "development", "metastatic", "macrophage-tumor", "cancer"], "source": "Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv", "slug": "development-of-a-macrophage-tumor-fusion-model"}}

As a legume, it strongly influences not only carbon and nitrogen dynamics but likely also the available species pool in the soil seed bank and soil microbial composition. Alterations to the soil microbial community can hinder the establishment of desired native plants that often require specific soil microorganisms. We present preliminary results from 1) a seed bank study assessing how kudzu affects the availability of seeds in the soil and 2) a greenhouse study testing how soil microbes associated with kudzu affect growth of plants native to Black Belt Prairies. Our results indicate that kudzu decreased the diversity and abundance of species in the seed bank. Further, especially native legumes produced lower biomass when grown with soil microbes associated with kudzu. We found weak support for the hypothesis that soil microbes from intact native communities provide a benefit for native plant establishment. Our next steps are to isolate and identify microbes associated with kudzu and to assess species-specific effects. Applying active intervention strategies that supplement the species pool in the seed bank and reverse soil microbial changes seem critical for the restoration of kudzu-invaded ecosystems.", "metadata": {"title": "Kudzu invasion effects on soil seed bank and soil microbial communities might hinder native restoration", "lead_presenters": ["Robert W.

We observed that in in vitro DNA synthesis assays, its triphosphate metabolite may impede the synthetic activity of the mitochondrial replicative polymerase, Pol γ, when in excess over nucleotides. Prompted by this finding, we tested the effect of the nucleoside metabolite of remdesivir on the maintenance and integrity of the mitochondrial genome in proliferating fibroblasts. However, we found no evidence for deleterious effects of remdesivir on the integrity of the mitochondrial genome. In addition, we performed an analogical assessment of the effects of molnupiravir on the integrity of the mitochondrial genome.

In such tracking systems, the robot/camera system is required to follow a desired trajectory for relative position and orientation (pose) with respect to a target object. In typical outdoor applications, the actual pose of robot is measured by a Global Positioning System (GPS). However, GPS is not practical for indoor applications. In such cases, the pose error may be calculated using vision-based approaches. In this study, we explore fast and reliable vision-based target tracking system. We first created simulation models to create trajectories and tracking experiments using the python programming language. We have built the robotic vehicle using a iRobot Create 2 kit, Intel RealSense LiDAR Camera L515, and a Raspberry Pi 4 for the control module. Currently we work on implementation of simulated experiments on the actual robotic vehicle. We have reached promising results during the initial experiments.", "metadata": {"title": "Vision and Depth Based Trajectory Tracking for Mobile Robots", "lead_presenters": ["Jeffrey Deetman"], "other_authors": [], "mentor": "Semih Dinc", "department": "Computer Sciences", "category": "", "year": 2022, "keywords": ["mobile", "trajectory", "depth", "based", "system", "tracking", "camera", "robot"], "source": "Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv", "slug": "vision-and-depth-based-trajectory-tracking-for-mobile-robots"}}

This is a challenging task because of vague and indistinct cloud boundaries and translucent thin cloud patterns. In this study, we propose a lightweight and unsupervised methodology to identify cloud regions on a ground-based sky image. Our method offers a fast and adaptive segmentation approach without a necessity of fixed thresholds by utilizing a K-means based clustering approach on transformed pixel values. In the first step, pixels are clustered into three groups as clear sky, indeterminate, and cloud. In the second step, only indeterminate pixels are clustered into clear sky and cloud. In the final step, we apply a median based spatial filtering approach to eliminate mislabeled and isolated pixels. We have experimented our method in two datasets. The results showed that the proposed method achieves high segmentation accuracy without the need of fixed thresholding or tedious supervision process.", "metadata": {"title": "Cloud Region Segmentation from All Sky Images using Double K\u0002Means Clustering", "lead_presenters": ["Thi Hong Ngoc (Kylie) Tran"], "other_authors": [], "mentor": "Semih Dinc and Randy Russell", "department": "Computer Sciences and Chemistry", "category": "", "year": 2022, "keywords": ["cloud", "sky", "double", "segmentation", "region", "regions", "image", "step"], "source": "Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv", "slug": "cloud-region-segmentation-from-all-sky-images-using-double-k-means-clustering"}}

While cell-cell fusion occurs as a normal and essential cellular process, aberrant cell fusion has been linked to disease, including metastatic cancer. The cell fusion hypothesis was first put forward over 100 years ago by Professor Otto Aichel, a German pathologist, and has gained traction in recent years. The central tenet is that the fusion of tumor cells with bone marrow derived cells (BMDCs) may enhance the metastatic potential of the tumor cells due to changes in the gene expression pattern in the fused cell resulting from the addition of the BMDC nucleus, thus generating cells that are both motile and capable of continuous cell division. While the evidence above provides convincing evidence for macrophage tumor fusions as potentiators of metastatic disease, much remains unknown about the post\u0002hybridisation gene activation driving events leading to this phenotype. The mechanisms by which hybrid cells activate genes that enhance cell migration remains unresolved, and has been identified as an important area for investigation as a potential target for therapy. In order to conduct these investigations, it is necessary to first establish a model that can be utilized to conduct further investigations. Using the macrophage cell line RAW264.7, transfected to express GFP (RAW-GFP), and the colorectal cancer cell line HT-29 transfected to express RFP (HT-29 RFP), we will recapitulate conditions of the tumour microenvironment to generate cancer-macrophage fusion hybrids. Once the hybrids are established, we will then have a model in which to compare the phenotype and function of these cells to the parental tumor cells, HT-29 RFP.", "metadata": {"title": "Generation of a Tumour-Macrophage Model", "lead_presenters": ["Louise Gunawan", "Azura Murphy"], "other_authors": ["Linda Lewis", "Matthew Landry"], "mentor": "Ann Marie O'Neill", "department": "Biology and Environmental Science", "category": "", "year": 2022, "keywords": ["cell", "cells", "metastatic", "fusion", "tumor", "cancer", "disease", "rfp"], "source": "Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv", "slug": "generation-of-a-tumour-macrophage-model"}}

Most herbaria are small and have not yet been digitized and made accessible to the global scientific community in public databases, meaning that the information they contain is known only to a small number of scientists with direct access to the herbarium. Here we report how we digitized AUM’s small herbarium of around 1,000 specimens and uploaded specimen information to public biodiversity databases so that it is accessible to researchers outside of AUM. We also describe the contents of the herbarium collection, including number of species, genera, and families represented, as well as map the collection location of specimens. We also identify gaps in the collection to better guide future collection efforts.", "metadata": {"title": "Digitizing the AUM Herbarium: A Valuable Resource for Biodiversity Information", "lead_presenters": ["Samantha Mejia"], "other_authors": [], "mentor": "Vanessa Koelling", "department": "Biology and Environmental Science", "category": "", "year": 2022, "keywords": ["aum", "information", "valuable", "resource", "herbarium", "biodiversity", "herbaria", "collection"], "source": "Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv", "slug": "digitizing-the-aum-herbarium-a-valuable-resource-for-biodiversity-information"}}

The reactive oxygen species, mainly produced in mitochondrial activities in the human body, are related to aging, cancer initiation, and various neurologic disorders. It is known that many organic ingredients in commercial beverages contain a variety of different types of antioxidants. Suppression of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) by beverage was investigated in this study by using ultrasonic irradiation to the commercial beverage containing waters. Fluorometric measurement was applied to measure the amount of hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides in water after the ultrasonic irradiation. An interesting general trend of significant suppression from dark\u0002colored beverages was observed in this study. This study will help the general public understand how drinking beverages may reduce the health risk caused by unavoidable ROS in the human body.", "metadata": {"title": "Suppression of Reactive Oxygen Species by Beverages", "lead_presenters": ["Alexandra Jackson"], "other_authors": [], "mentor": "Duk \"Daniel\" Kim", "department": "Chemistry", "category": "", "year": 2022, "keywords": ["oxygen", "reactive", "species", "human", "beverages", "beverage", "suppression", "study"], "source": "Untitled spreadsheet - Sheet1.csv", "slug": "suppression-of-reactive-oxygen-species-by-beverages"}}
