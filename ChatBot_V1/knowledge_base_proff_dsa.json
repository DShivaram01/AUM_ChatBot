His primary research interest focuses on the biological functions of bacterial pigments and the use of bacteria as biological sensors to detect environmental contaminants. He is especially known for his work on a red pigment called prodigiosin, produced by the bacterium *Serratia marcescens*.\n\nHis early work suggested a negative role of the pigment in cellular energy production during periods of high cell multiplication. More recent research has shown that when energy levels are low, prodigiosin plays a positive role by enhancing cellular energy production, effectively doubling the yield of pigmented cells compared to non-pigmented ones. His most recent studies further define this dual role and are preparing for publication. \n\nDr. Haddix continues to explore how prodigiosin affects cellular energy fluxes in bacterial population growth.
